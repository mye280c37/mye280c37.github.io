## Simulation Scenario

---

1. **3 UEs with a single flow**
    
    There are 3 UEs attached to a gNB. Two UEs have non-GBR traffic with a 5QI of 80, and another UE has DC GBR traffic with a 5QI of 87.

2. **2UEs with multi-flow**
    
    There are 2 UEs attached to a gNB. One has non-GBR traffic with a 5QI of 80, and the other has two flows: non-GBR traffic with a 5QI of 80 and DC GBR traffic with a 5QI of 87.

## Conclusion

---

- When there is only a single flow in each UE, I observe that all non-GBR traffic experiences more severe delays compared to DC GBR traffic.
- As I analyzed the simulation results from the QoS scheduler paper, non-GBR traffic benefits when the UE with non-GBR traffic also has DC GBR traffic in a multi-flow configuration.

## Questions

---

1. Why does the DC GBR flow not gain as much as the non-GBR flow of UE2 loses when switching the scheduler from QoS-RR to QoS-QoS?
2. In Scenario 2 of Env.2, the non-GBR flow of UE2 is benefiting from the weight of the DC-GBR flow in scheduling. Therefore, it is expected that in Scenario 1, where there is no such benefit, UE1 and UE2 would share the delay equally and experience lower delays compared to the delay of UE1 in Scenario 2. However, both show similarly high delays of approximately 300ms. Why is this the case?
