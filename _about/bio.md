I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich under the supervision of Prof. [Jörg Ott].

I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, where I was advised by Prof. [Wha Sook Jeon]. My master's research focused first on resource allocation for device-to-device C-V2X sidelink communication, and later on designing an optimization framework for MAC-layer resource scheduling at the QoS-flow level.

I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Sogang University, South Korea. As an undergraduate researcher under Prof. [Jungmin So], I conducted research on improving spatial reuse in dense Wi-Fi environments, and also led several software development projects.
