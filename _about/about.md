<!-- **Currently Working on** | Mobile Computing & Communication Lab. in Seoul National University -->


I am a second semester Master's student advised by Prof. [Wha Sook Jeon] at Seoul National University, South Korea, conducting research on resource allocation method in NR-V2X.  

I acquired my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Sogang University in South Korea. During my time there, I worked as an undergraduate researcher under Prof. [Jungmin So], conducting research on improving spatial reuse in dense Wi-Fi environments. Additionally, I participated in and led several software projects.

## Research Interests

Currently, my research interests include the following:

- 5G/6G Network Architecture, Optimization, and Resource Management
- AI/ML-driven Solutions for Network Efficiency and Mobility
- MAC Layer Design and Optimization for Low-Latency (URLLC) Communications
- Smart City and Smart Mobility Applications using Edge Computing and SDN
- V2X Communication Systems and their Role in Next-Generation Mobility
- Integration of AI-based Resource Management in Dense and Dynamic Networks

I am deeply interested in V2X technology, which is fundamental for enabling fully autonomous driving and advanced vehicle infotainment systems. My research focuses on developing **Connected Mobility Systems** supported by **V2X** and includes a detailed study of the **PHY and MAC layers**. This spans from **LTE-V2X** and Korea’s **V2X standards** to **NR-V2X**, where I investigate **resource allocation methods** capable of meeting **QoS requirements** for diverse applications.

As **5G** evolves into **6G**, the increasing number of communication-dependent entities and system complexity will require advanced management techniques. My future research will explore **network slicing**, **task offloading** using **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**, and **Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)**, integrating these technologies into **6G networks** to support real-time decision-making and low-latency communications. My ultimate goal is to design comprehensive **connected mobility systems** that leverage these innovations to meet the demands of **autonomous driving** and **smart mobility**.
