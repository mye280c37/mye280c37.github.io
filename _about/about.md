<!-- **Currently Working on** | Mobile Computing & Communication Lab. in Seoul National University -->


I am a second semester Master's student advised by Prof. [Wha Sook Jeon] at Seoul National University, South Korea, conducting research on resource allocation method in NR-V2X.  

I acquired my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Sogang University in South Korea. During my time there, I worked as an undergraduate researcher under Prof. [Jungmin So], conducting research on improving spatial reuse in dense Wi-Fi environments. Additionally, I participated in and led several software projects.

## Research Interests

Currently, my research interests include below:
* Wireless Communication, especially Cellular and Wi-Fi
* Vehicle to Everything (V2X)
* Resource Management
* Connected Mobility
* Reinforcement Learning (RL)
* Autonomous Driving
