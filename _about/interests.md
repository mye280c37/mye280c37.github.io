- **Flow-level QoS-aware Resource Allocation at MAC layer**
  - Scheduling algorithms to provision QoS for each flow in B5G
  - Applying both optimization-based formulations and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches

- **Distributed Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks**
  - Addressing exposed and hidden terminal problems
  - Improving overall performance by estimating the states of neighboring devices

- **Cross-layer System-level Orchestration for Multi-flow Resource Allocation**
  - Establishing slicing policies by aggregating information of flows within each slice
  - Leveraging orchestration frameworks such as O-RAN to optimize the interactions between MAC-layer parameters and application-layer requirements *(further study)*
